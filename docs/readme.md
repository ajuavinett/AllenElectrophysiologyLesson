# Defining cell types by their electrophysiology

This GitHub repository provides code to complete a lesson plan to explore different cell types in the brain, using the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a> Cell Types dataset. **Please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/neuroedu/cell-types">this website</a> for a full description of the activities contained here.**

**New notebook!** ComparingCellFeatures.ipynb lets you work with a clean dataset (cell_metrics.csv) to compare features such as the surface area, rheobase, and input resistance. This can be used before or after the "CellTypes" notebooks, but should be used *after* the Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks.

#### You can work with these notebooks in either Binder or Colab, by using the buttons below:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ajuavinett/CellTypesLesson/master) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ajuavinett/CellTypesLesson)

#### There are several ways to implement these notebooks in your class:
- Run notebooks via Binder or Colab, as linked above.
- Set up a [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation-guide-hard.html) for your course or university (e.g., the [UCSD DataHub](http://datahub.ucsd.edu))
- Ask students to download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Python, which includes Jupyter Notebook, many useful packages and more, to run these notebooks locally.
