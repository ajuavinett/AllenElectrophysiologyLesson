    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to combine executable code, code outputs, and text into one connected file. They run in a web browser, but don't require the internet (unless you're running it on a Jupyter Hub). \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>'kernel'</b> is the thing that executes your code. It is what connects the notebook (as you see it) with the part of your computer, or the DataHub computers, that runs code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Menu Options & Shortcuts\n",
    "To get a quick tour of the Jupyter user-interface, click on the 'Help' menu, then click 'User Interface Tour'. There are also a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. Click on the 'Help' menu, and then 'Keyboard Shortcuts' to see a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks have two types of cells, a <b>Markdown</b> (like this one) and <b>Code</b>. Most of the time you won't need to run the Markdown cells, just read through them. However, when we get to a code cell, you need to tell Jupyter to run the lines of code that it contains.\n",
